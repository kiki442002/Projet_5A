<b><u>Main Changes</u></b><br>
<b>Maintenance Release for BLE, 802.15.4, Thread and Zigbee updates</b>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
	<li><b>BLE </b>updates</li>
		<ul> - New GAP commands for extended scan and connection have been created: ACI_GAP_EXT_START_SCAN and ACI_GAP_EXT_CREATE_CONNECTION.</ul>
		<ul> - New parameter setting SHCI_C2_BLE_INIT_BLE_CORE_5_4 for upgraded QDID and declaration ID of Stack BLE 5.4.</ul>
		<ul> - The following BLE primitives have been renamed: ACI_HAL_SET_SLAVE_LATENCY, ACI_GAP_SLAVE_SECURITY_REQ and ACI_GAP_SLAVE_SECURITY_INITIATED_EVENT to ACI_HAL_SET_PERIPHERAL_LATENCY, ACI_GAP_PERIPHERAL_SECURITY_REQ and ACI_GAP_PERIPHERAL_SECURITY_INITIATED_EVENT, respectively. Moreover, the event parameters Slave_Latency and Master_Clock_Accuray have been renamed to Latency and Central_Clock_Accuracy, respectively.</ul>
	<li><b>Zigbee </b>updates</li>
		<ul>- Inter core communication improvement (M4-M0+) on all Zigbee applications making it more robust in very extreme conditions (Environment in which with multiple messages need tobe processed at the same time).</ul>
	<li><b>MAC 802.15.4 / Thread / Zigbee </b>updates</li>
		<ul> - Enabling of some PHY features (continuous wave start/stop, rx_start/stop, tx_start, set_channel) in MAC/Thread/Zigbee and concurrent firmware.</ul>
		<ul> - Improvement of the trace mechanism in order to get M4 log timestamp available on all Thread/Zigbee and concurrent applications.</ul>			
</ul>
